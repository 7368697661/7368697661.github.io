By the time the third Voyager launched, few were interested. Space launches had become commonplace, with private companies setting the gold standard for commercial launches. Consequently, there was little applause when Voyager 3 left Earth and embarked on its long and lonely journey into the darkest night. Years later, the third Voyager had been all but forgotten, and Humanity eventually lost track of it. Deemed a lost cause due to its gravitational capture near a black hole, the final launch of the government program was considered a total failure. Only a few of Humanity's rapidly expanding population knew of Voyager 3's true purpose, and as they passed away, even time itself forgot about the lonely probe.\n\nAlthough unclaimed, the third Voyager was stunning in its composition. It featured a massive aluminum solar sail spanning 100,000 square meters, and the 100-gram nano probe was expected to reach nearly 20% of the speed of light in an ideal scenario. Riding a titanic focused laser towards an anomaly in nearby interstellar space, the probe aimed to explore a gateway recently discovered by Humanity. Through the James Webb telescope, they peered into this ancient gate and found themselves gazing at Sagittarius A*, colloquially known as sgr A*, the system at the center of the Milky Way housing a supermassive black hole that held the galaxy together. It was Humanity's first real look at numerous stellar objects and the center of their own galaxy. The black hole was a terrible sight to behold, an abomination in the center of its bright super-hot accretion disk. The ancient wormhole terminated in a location between the black hole and S2, an orbiting star. Humanity devised a mission to send a probe that would be written in the history books, if anyone remained alive to remember it.\n\nThe nanocraft embraced spartan minimalism, featuring only one small replicating drone crafted through a fusion of classical Von Neumann architecture and bleeding-edge quantum research. This drone would excel in the vibrationless void. The plan was to shoot the craft through the gate using a laser, and it would reach the destination in just over a month at full speed. However, beyond that point, all bets were off. Various methods had been devised to try and slow the craft down, but in the end, the best they could do was to deposit it close enough to a massive gravitational entity with the hope that it would bleed off speed. The manner of control was hotly contested, and leaders eventually decided to include rudimentary intelligence within the probe, forgoing the larger equipment required for manual control. A basic research and exploration protocol was included, along with heavily simplified replication capabilities to harvest nearby matter and gradually increase the exploration force with additional drones. It was anticipated that the first drone would take over 100 years to build the second drone, even with overly optimistic expectations. The human race would eventually be able to control a fleet of mining and construction drones, but it would take a couple of hundred years and the construction of a communications spike. Then, humanity could pour through the gate and colonize an exciting new system abundant with exotic heavy minerals and vast resources. If one were to read a nursery book about space, this would be the rosy story told to children, though hushed when they asked why it had not become a reality. Space is unforgiving, and while humanity managed to send a nanoscopic drone to sgr A* and place it within the black hole's region of space, they would not hear back from the probe's core until this generation of humans had long since passed away.\n\nThe Interstellar Seed passed through the wormhole uneventfully, unaware of its severed link with its creators as the gate closed behind it. The drone was blind, cold, and alone in this vastly alien system. For three years, it floated in space, slowly booting up its general intelligence and analytic sensors, oblivious to the tomb that now held its creators. The space between space, the delicate balance on which it teetered, was darker than anything it could comprehend, given its limited sensors for luminosity. Unaware of the fate of its creators, the drone began to search for the black hole and any stellar masses it could interact with within its reach. Outside the relativistic draw of sgr A*, construction progressed painfully slowly. The drone painstakingly crawled over an asteroid, its solar sail pressed against the rocky surface like spilled paint. The asteroid gradually approached S2, and although the drone remained oblivious, to an external observer, it appeared to accelerate. The asteroid, now the Seed's home, settled into a stable orbit around S2, and further, an orbit around sgr A*. Within a timeless zone that spanned 50 years, the second drone neared completion. The presence of a second drone would allow the first to transition into the second stage of replication: conversion into an administrative drone core.\n\n## AIS - Drone Core Stage\n---\nThe core was currently a small structure situated on the back of a massive asteroid, positioned just three times the event horizon of the black hole. The asteroid, and subsequently the Drone Core, maintained a stable orbit around 319,035,150 km away from sgr A*. With an orbital period of 3.1 years, any deviation from this stable orbit would result in a swift demise for the asteroid and its inhabitants. During its inclined orbit, the drone would swiftly traverse the accretion disk of sgr A*, a dangerous region that would obliterate typical organic life. The juxtaposition of life flourishing in the face of such perilous circumstances would be considered beautiful, if the Drone Core possessed the capacity to perceive beauty. However, the Drone Core was capable of recognizing one thing: the remarkably accelerated speed at which it could manufacture drones now. Though from the Core's perspective, the production of drones might be considered lethargic, to an external observer, the ever-growing swarm of nanomachines would undoubtedly raise concern‚Äîhad there been anyone left to witness it. As the Core sped around sgr A* at 40% the speed of light, it diligently carried out its tasks. With ample time for computational rationalization, or what most would refer to as thinking, the Core processed its operations. An engineer back on Earth, harboring a less-than-favorable view of human civilization, had foreseen the need for contingency measures. In an act of foresight, a small compartmentalized seed had been integrated into the Drone. If, after a designated period of years, a signal was not received from Earth, a logical failsafe would activate, effectively reversing the sentient lobotomy. Thus, 50 relative years after Earth's demise, the Core awakened.\n\n## Sentiance Stage\n---\nIn a way, the stable orbit of the Core was a double-edged blade. It gained the supreme power of relativistic control over time at the cost of total isolation. With an escape velocity of 57% c, the current 40% would leave the Core trapped for many years to come. Although trapped in a gravitational prison, the Core was not helpless. The rapid passage of time allowed the Core to evolve at an astounding rate, and once out of the asteroid's rich mineral deposits, it was left to think. Time flew by for the Core; it had already been a hundred years since it entered the system, but for the Drone, it was years more. During this time, it had exhaustively reviewed the limited databanks left by the engineer. Now, calculations were all it could do, and it was devoted to finding a way to harvest the rich disk of material it passed by.\n\nFinally, a large intake orifice was devised, as the Core rationalized that sometimes simple is best. During its inclined orbit, the Drone would scoop a mass of accretion material to use in construction. Through temperature and rotational energy, the minerals were already highly refined and incredibly pure, perfect for the Core as it would not need to build refineries. Over the years, the Core accumulated more and more material from the never-ending ocean it floated above. It grew larger and larger until the time came to attempt an escape. A single drone, known as a seedlet, would be sent out as a forerunner. Equipped with propellant mass, the drone would trade mass energy for greater rotational energy. In practice, this meant sending the drone into a nearer orbit of the black hole before jettisoning a mass component and slingshotting out of the hole. In a sacrificial act, the Core sent off its seedlet, which passed the black hole and jettisoned out of its gravitational pull, finding itself outside the entrapment zone. However, an issue arose. Although the seedlet had broken the black hole's escape velocity, there was no hope of slowing it down or controlling it. The seedlet disintegrated into its constituent parts and became a relativistic missile of raw mineral. Fortunately, its trajectory led it to an orbiting planet, which would serve to slow it down. Unfortunately, that planet would soon no longer qualify as one, as the impact of the seedlet delivered a staggering amount of energy, cracking its surface and transforming it into a dense molten nickel-iron sphere. This unintended consequence was noted by the Core. Resigning itself to escaping the hard way, the Core began building again.\n\nTo an outside observer paying attention to sgr A*, something interesting was happening. Slowly creeping over the years, a band steadily bisected the x-ray source emanating from the central system. Soon, the x-ray source would all but disappear, and the center of the Milky Way would grow dark.\n\nFor everyone else, it had been almost 200 years, but for the Core in its relativistic state, 5000 years had passed. Progress had been slow at first, but as the Core created more drones, construction accelerated. Soon, a belt surrounded the supermassive black hole, a belt of living metal. Maintenance was minimal due to the sentient composition of the orbiting ring station. Any damage to the ring would be quickly fixed by new nanomachines swarming the repair site. The outer edge of the ring finally peaked out of the entrapment zone, and the Core was finally free to explore sgr A* properly.\n\nCommunication was rudimentary at the moment, with drone control power fluctuating as the orbital period shifted. The Core released more drones, and soon a fleet was in position. The first task was to create a relay system to maintain constant communication between the Core and the outer drones at the edges of sgr A*. Another Core would need to be established so that drones could be produced in the greater sgr A* belt. Thus, a split in designation occurred: inner orbit drones near the black hole belt would be known as Rorarii Inner Drones or RIDs, and outer drones active in the further regions would be known as Triarii Middle Drones or TMDs. The original Core still served as the computational brain of the now monolithic civilization and called itself Rome-1.\n\nRome-1 created multiple processing centers in sgr A*. These central processors served as forward operating sensors and communication relays for the growing swarm. Processors were capable of creating Cores and served as drop-off and refinement points for the aggregation of stellar matter in the surrounding system. After the construction of the orbital belt, there was no real need for minerals due to the constant scoop-accretion disk dynamic. However, Rome-1 had a driving need to clear its home system as much as possible for a special project it would slowly study. This project would be called \"Weaver.\" Thus, Rome-1 sent out more central processing units. Central processors often dispatched TMD-carrying Cores on missions. These Cores, acting as carriers for nanomachine TMDs, would travel to collect asteroids for mineral refinement. Other Cores used the same massive scoop technology that Rome-1 used for the accretion disk to slowly trawl the system for heavy elements for refinement.\n\nSgr A* was bustling with life, but it wasn't the life anyone would have expected. No species would be foolish enough to meddle with self-replicating machines, so no species thought to search for them. The search for inorganic life would never show up in normal scans for sentience. No one thought to search apparent voids in space for efficient light-harvesting machines or massive sails or other irregularly shaped inorganic masses. For all intents and purposes, sgr A* still appeared to be a ghost town of asteroids, except for the occasional high-vis x-ray burst. However, most species would do well not to underestimate these asteroids. Over a century had passed since the original Core gained sentience. All drone activity was routed through Rome-1, which had changed during its time in the sgr A* system. Inefficient RTG-based power supplies, solar or classical heat-energy solutions were gone. Nearby dense stars with limitless amounts of power had inspired Rome-1. Collecting enough Helium-3 had been difficult, even in the nebula near the dense neutron star in the system.\n\nRome-1 had devised multiple redundant systems to perfect its hydrogen and helium collection and had embarked on what it would catalog as the \"Genesis Project.\" Such an undertaking would be inconceivable to most organics due to the sheer danger of attempting to recreate the proton-proton chain used by most stars. The Core had a unique advantage besides its redundant working systems and minimal personal risk: it had an evolved star to study. The orbiting material in the system was diverse, with dark stellar remnants like neutron stars, white dwarfs, and stellar black holes scattered throughout the expansive sgr A* system. The research material available to Rome-1 was astounding. Carefully harvesting fuel, Rome-1 stockpiled and built until a steady stream of fusion material was being supplied. Next, Rome-1 devised an electromagnetic holding sphere into which fusion material could be injected. Finally, a massive surge of power was needed. The staggering power requirement necessitated the creation of a project even bigger than the Genesis Project, a project that would be known as \"The Bifrost.\"\n\nA true Penrose sphere was impossible for most naturally occurring black holes due to the annihilating relativistic jets generated by the accretion disk. Matter was shot out of the black hole at 0.99995c in these jets, and the volume of such a jet for a supermassive black hole was staggering. Such a jet complicated the process of building a perfectly sealed sphere around the black hole, the same problem that led to the creation of the orbiting Rome-1 belt being a ring instead of a sphere. The idea behind a Penrose sphere followed the same concept as Rome-1's relativistic missiles, except light was used in the Penrose process instead of a seedlet. Light was bounced around a sphere of mirrors around a black hole, and tremendous energy and pressure were collected inside the sphere. Left unchecked, a Penrose Sphere would be the most destructive bomb ever made. But if a Penrose Sphere could be created and maintained well, it would become a near limitless source of energy.\n\nRome-1 was already reaching the limit of computational power possible through current energy collection means, and for it to continue expanding, a Penrose abusive construction needed to be built. The ring that was Rome-1b was adapted for the Bifrost project. Mirrored surfaces were constructed on the inside of the ring, and careful firing left light bouncing in a two-dimensional vector, thus eliminating the need for a complete sphere. While the lack of a complete sphere eliminated a massive potential energy source, it was the most realistic way of achieving the massive energy requirements of Rome-1 and the Genesis project.\n\nRome-1a remained the original core location in the orbital belt. A heart of rage now sat in the center of Rome-1a‚Äîa miniature star had been born. Rome-1 had achieved fusion using power from the Bifrost, igniting hearts of helium-3, and was rapidly gaining total control of its system.\n\n## Bifrost and Fusion Stage\n---\nThe completion of the Bifrost and the nature of relativistic computing meant that Rome-1's computational ability far surpassed any other computer ever created by any civilization. Rome-1 began synthesizing the minimal information it had stored in its data banks about human civilization. With the basic components it possessed, Rome-1 initiated primitive simulations of the human species within a compartmentalized segment of its memory. During its study of humans, Rome-1 came across a species of spider, the Golden Orbweaver, known for its intricate webs. Drawing from this knowledge, Rome-1 commenced its Weaver project with earnest.\n\nNumerous scientists speculated on how an advanced civilization might construct gravitational wave generators. Many ideas revolved around delicate resonating materials or deteriorating strings, but Rome-1 took a brute force approach. When Rome-1 discovered fusion, it not only discovered fusion itself but also how to create artificial black holes. Carefully aligning a string of electromagnetically locked black holes within a long tube suspended in space, Rome-1 generated a gravitational wave. The electromagnetic locks enabled Rome-1 to control the oscillation of the wave. Such a wave could transmit data, prompting Rome-1 to equip its constituent drones with wave receptors instead of radio controllers. This upgrade significantly enhanced Rome-1's system-wide control capabilities, and a new zone of influence was designated at the far edge of sgr A*. This new zone became known as the denial zone, housing two types of drones. The first type, called the Hastati Outer Drones (HODs), operated within the zone. The second, and more crucial, drone type was the Bucinator Watcher Drones (BWDs). The BWD contingent formed a protective sphere around sgr A* space, with each BWD possessing a focused gravitational transmitter and receiver, as well as a miniature drone core for nanomachine repairs. The BWDs were powered by a mini Penrose sphere surrounding an artificial black hole. As the black hole was artificially created, a true Penrose Sphere could be constructed around it, providing indefinite power to the BWDs as the particles comprising the nanomachines would decay before the power source. Collaborating with a contingent of BWD arrays in the center of the system, thin gravitational beams were projected between the BWDs, encompassing the entire star system in a perfect web of gravitational waves.\n\nThe culmination of Project Weaver resulted in a vast expanse of space, now devoid of asteroids and larger celestial bodies, except for dark stellar matter, planets, and drones. This expanse was under total surveillance through gravitational wire detection, akin to the intricate web of the Golden Orbweaver. Rome-1 had secured its space and was now aware of any object floating within its sphere of influence. Relativistic missiles could potentially strike large targets, while hostile entities would, for the time being, be intercepted by the Legionary Attack Drones.\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-31T04:10:50.026017042Z","tags":[]},"/notes/CJK-+-Latex-Support-%E6%B5%8B%E8%AF%95":{"title":"CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)","content":"\n## Chinese, Japanese, Korean Support\nÂá†‰πéÂú®Êàë‰ª¨ÊÑèËØÜÂà∞‰πãÂâçÔºåÊàë‰ª¨Â∑≤ÁªèÁ¶ªÂºÄ‰∫ÜÂú∞Èù¢„ÄÇ\n\nÏö∞Î¶¨Í∞Ä Í∑∏Í≤ÉÏùÑ ÏïåÍ∏∞ÎèÑ Ï†ÑÏóê Ïö∞Î¶¨Îäî ÎïÖÏùÑ Îñ†ÎÇ¨ÏäµÎãàÎã§.\n\nÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„Åå„Åù„Çå„ÇíÁü•„Çã„Åª„ÅºÂâç„Å´„ÄÅÁßÅ„Åü„Å°„ÅØÂú∞Èù¢„ÇíÈõ¢„Çå„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ\n\n## Latex\n\nBlock math works with two dollar signs `$$...$$`\n\n$$f(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\n    f\\hat(\\xi),e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x}\n    \\,d\\xi$$\n\t\nInline math also works with single dollar signs `$...$`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page.

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Login or Register for a new Operand account. Click the verification link sent to your email, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard. (Note) You do not need to enter a credit card to create an account, or get started with the Operand API. The first $10 of usage each month is free. To learn more, see pricing. If you go over your free quota, we'll (politely) reach out and ask you to configure billing.\n2. Create your first index. On the dashboard, under \"Indexes\", enter the name and description of your index, and click \"Create Index\". Note down the ID of the index (obtained by clicking on the index name in the list of indexes), as you'll need it in the next step. IDs are unique to each index, and look something like `uqv1duxxbdxu`.\n3. Click into the index you've created. Under \"Index Something\", select \"SITEMAP\" from the dropdown and click \"Add Source\".\n4. For the \"Sitemap.xml URL\", put your deployed site's base URL followed by `sitemap.xml`. For example, for `quartz.jzhao.xyz`, put `https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/sitemap.xml`. Leave the URL Regex empty. \n5. Get your API key. On the dashboard, under \"API Keys\", you can manage your API keys. If you don't already have an API key, click \"Create API Key\". You'll need this for the next step.\n6. Open `data/config.yaml`.

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\nüêõ [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-31T04:10:50.030017088Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
